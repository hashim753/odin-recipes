    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasagna.jpg">
    <p>Lasagna is a baked Italian dish built in layers: wide flat pasta sheets, rich sauce, creamy cheese, and a savory filling. The filling is commonly slow-cooked meat in tomato sauce or seasoned vegetables. Layers are stacked repeatedly, topped with cheese, and baked until the interior is hot and cohesive and the surface is browned. The result is dense, structured, and filling, with distinct layers that hold together when sliced.
